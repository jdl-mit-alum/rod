This is the abstract.

--- introduction ---
___Let's say that we take 100% brain use seriously.  All synapses of all neurons
are activated at the same time.  On the face of it, an undifferentiated
global pulse in the brain has no value at all, informationally similar to
no activity at all.  So 100% must mean something else.
^^^^
___There must be patterns of activity.  A pattern means a volume of activity next
to a volume of inactivity.  A naive view would choose 50/50 active/inactive
as 100% use of the brain.  However, this fails horribly.  Consider that an
image filled with white noise is essentially as useful as no activity at all.
^^^^
___Then, what makes activity informationally rich?  I propose that one should
expect something like a volume diffraction pattern expressing activity
identifying sharp boundaries between adjacent fields of undifferentiated
inactivity.  The ability for these boundaries to migrate as activity surfaces
through a field of inactivity seems like a viable starting hypothesis for
making best use of neural organs.  So, if this hypothesis were reasonable, and
we wanted to be able to move an activity surface over 10 times its surface
depth as wiggle-room, that would already cut down useful activity to no more
than \(\frac{1}{10}th\) of the cells in the brain.  But this presupposes that one has a
laminated layer-cake of activity as best use.  This makes no sense either since
there is little informational richness in moving layers up and down relative to
each other.  So, a more informationally appropriate use would be bubbles of
activity where the surface of activity surrounds a volume of inactivity and
which bubble is sufficiently distant from other bubbles.  Still using the
factor of 10 suggested before, and a volume containing bubbles of radius 10 and
kept a distance 10 away from nearest neighbors,  the unit activity surface is
\(4 \pi r^2\) and the volume is \(2\frac{4 \pi r^3}{3}\) for
an active/total population ratio
of \(\frac{1}{60}th\) of the cells in the brain.  So, for any more than 1 out of every 60
cells to be active would support this second approximation of informationally
useful activity.  But this, also, is inappropriate because a box full of same
size bubbles is still informationally poor.  This is where we come back to the
idea of "3D diffraction patterns".  The original holograms had a peculiar
zebra-stripe appearance where shining a reference laser at an angle caused a 3D
image of a scene to be visible.  These holograms were 2D diffraction patterns
capable of storing 3D information.  My third hypothesis is that 3D diffraction
patterns supported by neural organs are capable of reproducing 3D images with
acceptable time-transitions.  Such a scheme would require the wiggle-room to be
larger in places, such that the likely population of active neurons could be
cut possible by an order of magnitude.  So, now we are down to 1 in every
600-1000 brain cells active at any given time.
^^^^
___My guess is that more "intelligent" people are the ones capable of performing
more transforms on these activity surfaces to achieve a more varied outcome
while less "intelligent" people use a more limited set of transforms.  But this
is rank speculation with no foundation in existing literature.  I am conducting
experiments to collect anecdotal evidence that the hypothesis is plausible.
The experiments involve rote training to install alternative dissimilar reflex
pathways for people presented with situations in which their prior reflexes
were monotonous.
^^^^
___Sherrington, who won the Nobel Prize for his work in neuroscience proposed that
there is no single neuron unaffected by every other neuron in the nervous
system.  All activity is as a contributing member of a community and all
neurons contribute.  Since all cells are autonomous cells, they perform normal
cellular functions as well as providing signals to distant cells when necessary
and sufficient conditions are met.  The notion of using only 10% is difficult
to understand.  "They also serve who only stand and wait" (Churchill).
^^^^
___The vast majority (perhaps 97% or more) of axons are fully insulated without
nodes of Ranvier (no access to external ions needed for Hodgkin&Huxley membrane
pulse propagation) and therefore not carriers of membrane pulses.  To see how
the ubiquitous "unmyelinated" axons are insulated, review the image in Grays
Anatomy 35th British Edition, W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1973, pg
782.  To justify the 97%, see "Functional properties of regenerated optic axons
terminating in the primary olfactory cortex", Scalia, Brain Research, 685
(1995) 187-197 (speculation: Lissauer's tract in the spinal cord is vanishingly
small yet may contain more axons than the entire rest of the spinal cord).  The
reason investigators prefer experiments on myelinated axons is that they are
larger and easier to investigate; which means only 3% of axons generate the
"pulses" used for the modern practice of brain mapping.  Measuring gross
signals in the smaller axons is published in the Gasser and Erlanger 1944 Nobel
lectures.  Measuring them individually is published in "What the Frog's Eye
Tells the Frog's Brain", Lettvin, Proceedings of the IRE, November 1959, pg
1940-1951.
^^^^
___From what I have been able to interpret, a lot of the activity of the brain is
the attempt to inhibit activity (bulbar inhibitory system).  The inhibitory
system is extraordinarily powerful with much global general inhibition
preventing excitations and more focal inhibitions constraining excitations in
more specific ways. Strychnine, apparently, increases activity in the central
nervous system.  An animal with strychnine poisoning was relieved of seizures
by stimulating the bulbar inhibitory system (private communication with J. Y.
Lettvin).

--- Assumptions ---
Because of the “all-or-none” character of nervous activity, neural events and
the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is
found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the
addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and
that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a
net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular
choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the
sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another
net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps
not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.
